# Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis

# What the Project Does
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis in Python using two different techniques: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) with a bag-of-words approach and a pre-trained Roberta model from Hugging Face. The notebook covers data reading, basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of sentiment analysis models to analyze the sentiment of Amazon reviews.

# Why the Project is Useful
Sentiment analysis is valuable for understanding the emotional tone of text data. In this project, we employ VADER, a rule-based sentiment analysis tool, and a pre-trained Roberta model, a transformer-based approach. The combination provides insights into both traditional and advanced sentiment analysis methods, catering to different user preferences and requirements.
